## Overview
Neuronetworks are powerful! We want to use them to analyze data sets and make predictive models

### Estimated Time Cost: 10 hrs (round to nearest 0.1)

### Prerequisites:

- Something you should know beforehand: there will be a lot of python and jupiter notebooks involved!
- Something you will need installed beforehand... tensorflow, matplotlib, 

1. Import LSTM kera package from tensorflow
2. Add Sequential layers
3. Retrieve data, fit data, and then scale data based on index 0 to 1
    ```
    generic code block or terminal command
    ```
   and/or...
    ```javascript
    var foo = "this that JS tho";
    ```
   and/or...
    ```python
    print("this that Python tho")
    ```
   and/or...
4. Pass data through LSTM model, you can graph validation loss/ testing/training loss
5. Train da machine

* Kaggle
